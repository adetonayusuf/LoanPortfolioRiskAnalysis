## Risk Assessment and Analysis: Analyzing Loan Portfolio Risk for Daiz Bank

### Business Overview/Problem
Daiz bank’s challenge revolves around the management of their vast and diverse loan portfolio—a portfolio that has been the cornerstone of the bank's success. There is an immediate need to effectively assess and mitigate this multifaceted loan portfolio risk as this exposes the bank to constant threat of financial losses, regulatory hurdles, and reputational damage. The problem at hand is not just about safeguarding the bank's own interests but also ensuring the financial well-being of countless clients who have entrusted their dreams and aspirations to this esteemed institution.


Moreover, Daiz Bank's legacy risk assessment approaches have become increasingly inefficient in an era where speed and precision are paramount. Economic landscapes evolve rapidly, and the bank must adapt to ever-shifting market dynamics, regulatory changes, and emerging risks. The need of the hour is a dynamic, data-driven approach to risk assessment—one that not only identifies risks but also proactively mitigates them in real-time. To remain at the forefront of the financial industry, the bank must confront this challenge head-on, ushering in a new era of risk management that leverages the power of data analytics to safeguard its assets, reputation, and, above all, the trust of its clients

### Rationale for the Project

Risk analysis refers to the assessment process that identifies the potential for any adverse events that may negatively affect Daiz Bank in the process of giving out a loan. Conducting a risk analysis can help the bank determine whether they should approve a loan or financial application, and what actions they may need to take to protect their interests. This type of analysis facilitates a balance between risks and risk reduction. 

 
Risk analytics provides the tools and methodologies to analyze vast datasets, identify hidden patterns, and extract actionable insights in real-time. Unlike traditional methods that rely on historical data, risk analytics offers the advantage of adaptability. It can continuously process incoming data, enabling the bank to respond promptly to shifting market dynamics, economic indicators, and emerging risks. By harnessing the predictive power of analytics, the bank can proactively identify potential trouble spots within the portfolio, enabling timely interventions that mitigate losses and uphold the institution's financial health.
 

Risk analytics enables the bank to differentiate between high and low-risk clients and tailor its lending strategies accordingly. For clients, this means fairer loan terms, while for the bank, it translates into a more diversified portfolio. In essence, it allows the bank to strike a balance between profitability and risk exposure, ensuring long-term financial sustainability.

 
Lastly, risk analytics isn't just about managing risk; it's also about optimizing opportunities. By delving deep into the data, Daiz Bank can identify underserved markets, customer segments with growth potential, and innovative lending products. This proactive approach doesn't just shield the bank from potential losses; it propels it forward into a future where data isn't just a tool for risk mitigation, but a catalyst for growth.

### Aim of the Project
This project carries a lofty mission: to revolutionize the bank's approach to loan portfolio risk assessment. Our endeavor is rooted in the belief that data analytics, powered by advanced tools like Power BI, holds the key to unlocking unparalleled insights. These insights will not only empower the bank to make more informed lending decisions but also to optimize their risk management strategies. 

 
The bank’s aim is not merely profitability, but the creation of a resilient and diversified portfolio that thrives in the face of uncertainty, reduces credit losses, ensures compliance with ever-evolving regulations and more importantly, propels the bank forward into a future where data isn't just a tool for risk mitigation, but a catalyst for growth and innovation.

### Tech Stack
The data analysis for this project will be carried out Power BI. 


✓ Data Importation: Import the data into the environment.

✓ Data Cleaning and Manipulation

✓ Data Exploration and Analysis.

✓ Data Visualization.

### Project Scope
✓ Data Importation & Cleansing: Import data into the power BI  environment and cleanse it by identifying and rectifying errors, missing values, and inconsistencies in the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

✓ Exploratory Data Analysis: Power BI is utilized to generate descriptive statistics, such as summary statistics, distribution plots.

✓ Data Visualization: Power BI interactive dashboards and visualization capabilities enable the creation of charts, graphs, and heatmaps to uncover patterns and trends within the loan portfolio data.

✓ Reporting & Recommendation: Power BI facilitates the creation of customized reports for stakeholders, including bank executives, risk management teams, and regulators. These reports provide actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making.
